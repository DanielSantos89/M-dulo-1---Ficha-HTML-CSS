    <h1>Justin Beaver:Ever since  I learned HTML, my life has made a complete 180</h1>
    <p>Posted by: Damian Wielgosik</p>
    <p>Justin Beaver confessed something that even his greatest fans would haver never expected of the skilled musicians and lyricist.
        The young rock-and-roller admitted that<br> since he typed his first title tag, his life became easier. It has been reported by those
        surronding the Canadian that Beaver's private mentors, Ryan Loseling and<br> Nicolas Crate, often walk around Los Angeles disputing what
        a great tool the HTML validator is.</p>

    <p>Beaver has already created some websites and does not intend to stop here. "I will probably have a song about HTML on my next album,"
